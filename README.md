Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of ensemble learning techniques, including Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking, to analyze a dataset related to depression. The goal is to predict depression severity based on various features in the dataset.

Key objectives:

Utilize ensemble models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
Leverage interpretability tools like LIME and SHAP to explain model predictions.
Perform hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.
Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Implementation of multiple ensemble learning techniques:
Bagging (e.g., Random Forest)
Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost)
Stacking
Model interpretability using LIME, SHAP, and Shapash.
Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.
